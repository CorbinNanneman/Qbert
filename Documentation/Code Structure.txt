This is a detailed description of all source code files.
Unless specified as a .cpp or a .h file, any file name can be assumed to be a class with both a .h and .cpp file.
Files names are lowercase.
A '-' before a variable or function signifies that a function is private, while a '+' signifies it is public.

|   "statemanager.h"
|
| +int main()
| |

| |
| | Variables:
| |   game() : StateManager - Game instance
| |
| | Return:

|
| +isClosed() : bool
| |
| | Returns true if window has closed, false if not.
| |
| | Variables:
