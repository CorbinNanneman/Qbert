This is a detailed description of all source code files.
Unless specified as a .cpp or a .h file, any file name can be assumed to be a class with both a .h and .cpp file.
Files names are lowercase.
A '-' before a variable or function signifies that it is private, while a '+' signifies that it is public.

main.cpp
|
| Acts as a driver for the program, but doesn't host any of the game or display logic.
| 
| Includes:
|   "statemanager.h"
|
| +int main()
| |
| | Holds the game loop. Makes calls to StateManager to drive the program.
| |
| | Variables:
| |   game() : StateManager - Game instance
| |
| | Return:
| |   int : 0 on program exit
| \_
\_


StateManager
|
| Does the bulk of the game logic calculations.
| Handles all moving objects, events, and display operations.
|
| Includes:
|   <SFML/Graphics.hpp>
|   <vector>
|   "gameobject.h"
|   "platform.h"
|
| -enum Screen
| {
|   title = 0
|   load = 1
|   game = 2
|   leaderboard = 3
| }
|
| Data Members:
|   -screen       : Screen - Current screen
|   -screenWidth  : double - Width of viewport
|   -screenHeight : double - Height of viewport
|   -frame        : int - Tracks what frame of second game loop is currently on
|   -window()     : sf::RenderWindow - Target for drawing game objects
|   -objects()    : std::vector<GameObject*> - Stores access to all currently active objects
|   -platform()   : Platform - Map/Cube controller
|
| +clear() : void
| |
| | Clears the window based on screen
| \_
|
| +update() : void
| |
| | Calls updates on all objects, calls stateLogic(), and updates frame counters.
| \_
|
| +draw() : void
| |
| | Draws all GameObjects to window buffer, then displays buffer.
| \_
| 
| +isClosed() : bool
| |
| | Returns true if window has closed, false if not.
| |
| | Variables:
| |   closed = false : bool - return value
| | 
| | Return:
| |   bool : closed
| \_
|
| -stateLogic() : void
| |
| | Does special operations based on current screen.
| \_
\_


GameObject
|
| Any part of the game that is displayed to the screen.
| Contains basic display functionalities like position and image.
|
| Includes:
|   <SFML/Graphics/Texture.hpp>
|   <SFML/Graphics/Sprite.hpp>
|
| Data Members:
|   -x       : float - horizontal position coordinate
|   -y       : float - vertical position coordinate
|   -vX      : float - horizontal velocity
|   -vY      : float - vertical velocity
|   -texture : sf::Texture - Refers to image file to be used by sprite
|   -sprite  : sf::Sprite - Manage the image drawn to screen for the object
|
| +update( ) : void
| |
| | Applies velocity changes, then updates sprite position.
| \_
|
| +setX( float newX ) : void
| |
| | Sets the horizontal position to specified value.
| \_
|
| +setY( float newY ) : void
| |
| | Sets the vertical position to the specified value.
| \_
|
| +setVX( float newVX ) : void
| |
| | Sets the horizontal velocity to the specified value.
| \_
|
| +setVY( float newVY ) : void
| |
| | Sets the vertical velocity to the specified value.
| \_
|
| +getX( ) : float
| |
| | Returns the horizontal position value.
| |
| | Return:
| |  int : x
| \_
|
| +getY( ) : float
| |
| | Returns the vertical position value.
| |
| | Return:
| |   int : y
| \_
|
| +getVX( ) : float
| |
| | Returns the horizontal velocity value.
| |
| | Return:
| |   int : vX
| \_
|
| +getVY( ) : float
| |
| | Returns the vertical velocity value.
| |
| | Return:
| |   int : vY
| \_
|
| +getSprite( ) : sf::Sprite*
| |
| | Returns a reference to the sprite.
| |
| | Return:
| |   sf::Sprite* - &sprite
| \_
|
| +setTexture( char* texPath, __int16 texWidth, __int16 texHeight ) : void
| |
| | Loads a new texture from an image file.
| | texWidth and texHeight refer to the dimensions of the part of the texture displayed to the screen, 
| | not the entire texture.
| |
| | Loads the texture from file, 
| | sets the texture of the sprite to the texture (?), 
| | sets the texture rectangle of the sprite with dimensions texWidth and texHeight,
| | and sets the origin of the sprite.
