          Game Elements
\------------------------------/

This is a list of all elements of the game and their explanations.

/------------------------------\
          Characters
\------------------------------/

All characters are able to move in only two directions,
except for Q*Bert and Coily.

Unless otherwise specified, characters cause Q*Bert to lose a life upon contact.

Q*Bert
  The protagonist of the game.
  The user controls Q*Bert in order to change the colors on the map.
  Unlike most characters, Q*Bert is able to move in any direction

Coily/Purple Ball
  Coily begins life as a purple ball, which acts like any other ball.
  But instead of bouncing off of the world, the purple ball hatches into Coily.
  Coily follows the player, and is able to move in any direction.
  The only way for coily to fall off the world is to trick him into jumping after Q*Bert when Q*Bert jumps on a disc.
  If coily falls off the map, all enemies are removed from the map, and the player is rewarded with 500 points.

Red Ball
  The red ball falls into the top of the map, then bounces down in random directions.

Magic Ball
  The magic ball acts like a red ball, but does not cause Q*Bert to lose a life upon hitting him.
  Instead, it freezes all other enemies, and allows Q*Bert to move freely for a few seconds.

Slick
  Slick starts at the top of the map and acts like a ball, jumping down either left or right.
  When he lands on a block, he reverts it back to its original color.
  When Q*Bert lands on Slick, Slick is UTTERLY DESTROYED, and is crushed beyond existance.

Sam
  Sam acts much like Slick, but changes the block back to the previous color rather than the original.
  Sam, like slick, also gets COMPLETELY SQUISHED when he comes into contact with Q*Bert.

Wrongway
  Wrong way acts like a ball, but for him, down is the right side of the screen.
  He jumps on the sides of blocks, and stands on the left and bottom sides of the map and falls off the right.

Ugg
  Wrong way is a lot like Ugg, except he can stand on the right and bottom sides of the map, and falls off the left side instead.


/------------------------------\
              Map
\------------------------------/

Platform
  The platform is what all characters jump on.
  The platform consists of 28 blocks.
  The first row (at the top) has 1 block, the next row has 2, and so on until the last row (at the bottom) which has 7 blocks.

  When all blocks match the target color, the player wins the round.
  After the player wins the fourth round, the player moves to the next level,
  where the color pattern changes and the game becomes more difficult.

Block
  Blocks are what make up the platform.
  When Q*Bert lands on a block, he changes it's color.
  When Slick or Sam land on a block, they change it's color.

Disc
  The discs are objects which Q*Bert can jump onto to ride to the top of the map.
  They can be used to trick coily into jumping off the map if he is close behind.
  There is at least 2 in every level.

      Information Overlay

Player
  Displayed in the top left corner of the screen.
  Displays player 1 or 2, depending on which player is playing.

Score
  Displayed under player.
  Tells the player how many points they have earned.

Target Color
  Tells the player which color to change all blocks to.
